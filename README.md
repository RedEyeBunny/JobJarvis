# JobJarvis
Tired of applying to jobs and not remembering them thereafter? Well now you can forget all about them because JobJarvis can do that for you.

## What does it do?
It keeps a record of all your applied jobs from different websites in 1 single database and tracks those jobs for you. If it doesn't see any updates for a job for an extended peroid of time, JobJarvis will remind you of the job entry.
It may even take action on your behalf like sending an email to the recruiter asking for an update.
